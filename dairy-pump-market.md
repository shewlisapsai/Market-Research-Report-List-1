<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dairy pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dairy pump market is primarily divided into two types: positive-displacement and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps function by trapping a fixed volume of liquid and then forcing it out, making them ideal for moving thick or viscous dairy products, ensuring consistent flow rates. Centrifugal pumps, on the other hand, utilize rotational energy to generate flow and pressure, making them suitable for thinner liquids. Both types cater to various dairy applications, ensuring efficiency and reliability in product handling.</p></p>
