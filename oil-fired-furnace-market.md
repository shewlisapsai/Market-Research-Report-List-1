<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Fired Furnace Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Condensing Oil Fired Furnace</li><li>External Condensing Oil Fired Furnace</li><li>Non Condensing Oil Fired Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-fired furnace market comprises three main types: Internal Condensing, External Condensing, and Non-Condensing furnaces. Internal Condensing furnaces feature built-in heat exchangers that enhance efficiency by recovering heat from flue gases. External Condensing models achieve high efficiency by allowing exhaust gases to condense outside the unit, maximizing energy use. Non-Condensing furnaces are simpler and typically less efficient, venting exhaust gases directly without recovery. These types cater to varying energy efficiency needs and installation preferences in residential and commercial settings.</p></p>
